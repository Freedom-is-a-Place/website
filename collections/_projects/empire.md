![jhu in the middle east](/assets/images/gen/projects/jhu_gentrifies_ME_lr.gif)
This gif shows the drastic urban gentrification project undertaken by the East Baltimore Development Initiative (EBDI) that displaced and dispossessed 800 predominantly Black and Brown families from the Middle East neighborhood, now renamed Eager Park. 
EBDI is anchored by Johns Hopkins University and includes several other private developers. The project was announced in 2001 with no prior notification given to residents who read about losing their home in the local newspapers. The gif shows the demolition that displaced families and the subsquent private development led by Johns Hopkins in expanding its medical empire between the years of 2002 to 2023.
