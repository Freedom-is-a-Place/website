# About the project

Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s phrase **“freedom is a place”** means that **freedom is not only an idea or a feeling—it has to be material, organized, and built in the real world.**

> *“Abolition geography starts from the homely premise that freedom is a place. Place-making is normal human activity: we figure out how to combine people, and land, and other resources with our social capacity to organize ourselves in a variety of ways…”*

She pushes back against the idea that liberation is simply about changing laws or changing minds. Instead, she argues that **freedom has to take shape in actual spaces, infrastructures, and relationships** -- where people can live, survive, and thrive outside of systems that cage, punish, or abandon them. Freedom takes form as geography: spaces that support life rather than restrict it.

This, the building and making of life-giving places and liberatory spaces, is **abolition geography**. 

## Organized Abandonment

An important foundation of building an abolition geography is understanding the idea of organized abandonment. **Organized abandonment**, as explained by Gilmore, refers to the deliberate, systematic withdrawal of resources, protections, and opportunities from certain communities—typically poor, Black, brown, immigrant, and working-class populations.

User experience is about how a user interacts with, and experiences, a particular product, system or service. As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

## Mapping "Red" and "Green"

In this project, we adopt Gilmore's idea of mapping along "red" and "green" to understand how landscapes are produced through racial capitalism. 

Gilmore’s idea of red and green mapping is a method for understanding how state power, capital, and environmental conditions shape life chances across space. 

**“Red”** mapping tracks the spatial patterns of harm and extraction.
- These are the forces that shorten life, create precarity, and make communities vulnerable.
- Red maps visualize the organized abandonment of certain communities and the way racial capitalism sorts risk geographically.

**“Green”** mapping shows the forces that sustain life: care, resources, resistance, and possibility. 
- It’s a method to identify **where people build, nurture, and defend life-giving infrastructures.**
- Reveals the infrastructures of survival—the places where people create freedom, not as an abstract ideal but as material, spatial practice.

Gilmore explains that in order to transform the world, we need to understand both the red and the green as intertwined. **Places being harmed by police and abandonment are also the places where people resist and create new forms of care.**

She also underscores the importance of analyzing the red and the green not only locally but also to understand how struggles are connected across borders. The same forces producing dispossesion in one place produce it elsewhere. The same debt regimes (the IMF and the World Bank) draining public budgets in the Global South mirror austerity and abandonment in U.S. cities. The same corporations siting toxic industries in the U.S. South are extracting minerals in West Africa. **Recognizing this pattern is what makes international solidarity rational, not moralistic.** The red maps show how struggles are materially linked, and the green maps show how solutions resonate across place. When you overlay the two globally, you’re able to identify, for example:
- the same supply chains producing both environmental devastation and migrant labor precarity
- the same military networks connecting policing in Baltimore to the Israeli Occupation Forces in occupied Palestine
- the same climate forces driving community organizing around water, food, land, and survival

Identifying these patterns means understanding solidarity isn’t merely “supporting people over there.” It is recognizing that the map itself is shared—that the forces harming people abroad are the same forces shaping conditions at home. And that sharpening our abolitionist strategies at home responds to and shapes shared geographies structurally. 

**Freedom is a Place** is a collective project, our humble attempt at documenting, studying, and ultimately, contributing to the place-making in the city of Baltimore. We invite you to view this project as your own, and please get in touch with us if you would like to host your research here or help contribute to this project of abolition geography! As we grow this project, we hope to skill share so that you can translate these methods to your own local places and geographies. 

Solidarity forever. 



# Who are we?

We started this project as two comrades, Owen and Janvi, who organize together towards the abolition of prisons and policing in Baltimore with the community-led organization, the Baltimore Abolition Movement.
