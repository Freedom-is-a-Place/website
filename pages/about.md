# About the project

**Freedom is a Place** is a collective project, our humble attempt at documenting, studying, and ultimately, organizing to make freedom a place in the city of Baltimore. We invite you to view this project as your own, and please get in touch with us if you would like to host your research here or help contribute to this project of abolition geography! As we grow this project, we hope to skill share so that you can translate these methods to your own local places and geographies. 

## Where does the phrase *Freedom is a Place* come from?

Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s phrase **“freedom is a place”** means that **freedom is not only an idea or a feeling—it has to be material, organized, and built in the real world.**

> *“Abolition geography starts from the homely premise that freedom is a place. Place-making is normal human activity: we figure out how to combine people, and land, and other resources with our social capacity to organize ourselves in a variety of ways…”*

She pushes back against the idea that liberation is simply about changing laws or changing minds. Instead, she argues that **freedom has to take shape in actual spaces, infrastructures, and relationships** -- where people can live, survive, and thrive outside of systems that cage, punish, or abandon them. Freedom takes form as geography: spaces that support life rather than restrict it.

This, the building and making of life-giving places and liberatory spaces, is **abolition geography**.

<summary><h2>Organized Abandonment</h2></summary>
<br>
An important foundation of building an abolition geography is understanding the idea of organized abandonment. **Organized abandonment**, as explained by Gilmore, refers to the deliberate, systematic withdrawal of resources, protections, and opportunities from certain communities—typically poor, Black, brown, immigrant, and working-class populations.

<summary><h2>Mapping "Red" and "Green" </h2></summary>
<br>
<p>In this project, we adopt Gilmore's idea of mapping along "red" and "green" to understand how landscapes are produced through racial capitalism.  </p>

<p>Gilmore’s idea of red and green mapping is a method for understanding how state power, capital, and environmental conditions shape life chances across space.  </p>

<br>

<b>“Red”</b>mapping tracks the spatial patterns of harm and extraction.
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>These are the forces that shorten life, create precarity, and make communities vulnerable.e</li>
  <li>Red maps visualize the organized abandonment of certain communities and the way racial capitalism sorts risk geographically.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>“Green”</b> mapping shows the forces that sustain life: care, resources, resistance, and possibility. 
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>- It’s a method to identify <b>where people build, nurture, and defend life-giving infrastructures.</b></li>
  <li>Reveals the infrastructures of survival—the places where people create freedom, not as an abstract ideal but as material, spatial practice..</li>
</ul>

<p> Gilmore explains that in order to transform the world, we need to understand both the red and the green as intertwined. <b>Places being harmed by police and abandonment are also the places where people resist and create new forms of care.<b> </p>

Carey St., in West Baltimore (police stand in front line formation)" alt="Photo of kid in red hoody confronting police" link="https://anacostia.si.edu/collection/archives/object/sova-acma-06-085-ref563" target="\_blank" %}

<p>She also underscores the importance of analyzing the red and the green not only locally but also to understand how struggles are connected across borders. The same forces producing dispossesion in one place produce it elsewhere. The same debt regimes (the IMF and the World Bank) draining public budgets in the Global South mirror austerity and abandonment in U.S. cities. The same corporations siting toxic industries in the U.S. South are extracting minerals in West Africa. <b>Recognizing this pattern is what makes international solidarity rational rather than moralistic.</b> The red maps show how struggles are materially linked, and the green maps show how solutions resonate across place. When you overlay the two globally, you’re able to identify, for example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>the same supply chains producing both environmental devastation and migrant labor precarity</li>
  <li>the same military networks connecting policing in Baltimore to the Israeli Occupation Forces in occupied Palestine</li>
  <li> the same climate forces driving community organizing around water, food, land, and survival</li>
</ul>

<p> Identifying these patterns means understanding solidarity isn’t merely <i>“supporting people over there”</i>, it is recognizing that the map <i>itself</i> is shared. The forces harming people abroad are the same forces shaping conditions at home. And that sharpening our abolitionist strategies at home responds to and shapes shared geographies structurally. </p>

# Who are we?

We started this project as two comrades, Janvi and Owen, who organize together towards the abolition of prisons and policing in Baltimore with the community-led organization, the Baltimore Abolition Movement.

<br>
<p> I felt the effects of organized abandonment as a graduate worker at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, MD, before I had Gilmore’s vocabulary to articulate it. 
Through my organizing on campus, helping build the graduate worker union,<a href="https://trujhu.org">TRU-UE 197</a>, negotiating with the University administration for basic protections for workers, I realized quickly that the university system functioned much less as a site of knowledge production and more as a real estate developer and hedge fund that made decisions based on profit, prestige, and self-preservation. This issue is not unique to Johns Hopkins, but universities in the United States at large, that hoard billions in their endowments, function as outposts of US imperialism, develop war-profiteering technologies and research, and are financially entangled with an international system seeking to maintain the US empire. </p>
<br>
<p>I realized that not only were my coworkers and I being exploited in this system of organized abandonment as underpaid and unprotected workers, but more importantly, our wage relationship to this institution was being used to further Hopkins’ colonial interests in maintaining a violent relationship of organized abandonment with the city of Baltimore, and as I later learned, globally as well.</p> 
<br>
<p>Our presence in the city, as privileged members of the Hopkins community, was being leveraged to securitize the border between "us" and "them", "them" being the criminal city of Baltimore. We are told the red lines between privileged Hopkins students and the rest of the city, hard-coded through special Hopkins-only shuttles, securitized by Johns Hopkins private police, and surveilled block by block by city police, are for our “safety”. But I know these vestiges of Jim Crow are nothing more than an attempt to exert institutional, undemocratic control over the city. My response to this tension was to organize with my comrades in the labor movement and community organization, the <a href="https://baltimoreabolitionmovement.org">Baltimore Abolition Movement</a>, for the abolition of the undemocratic and privatized expansion of armed policing, the Johns Hopkins Police Department -- JHU's tool for colonial enforcement. </p>
<br>
<p>It is through this organizing that I understood the power of counter-mapping, illustrating in a new way what Baltimoreans have been elevating for decades. Maps that ask "Who profits from policing these boundaries?”, “Who is inside the prisons and who is outside?", and “How are resources distributed within the city?" help us communicate the urgency of abolition and mobilizing intervention.</p>
<br>
<p>Our horizon set on building an abolition geography, Owen and I started Freedom is a Place -- a collective project, for Baltimoreans and by Baltimoreans, built on decades of grassroots work done in the city, led by examples from critical geographers across the country.</p> 
<br>
<p>With this project, I personally hope to study some of the following questions from a Marxist-Leninst perspective: What are we building to grow in the gaps that empire leaves behind? How will we join efforts to build infrastructure that serves liberation? What will replace extraction and generate wealth for our people? How will we create systems for dignified work?</p> 
<br>
<p>We invite you to join us, contribute to this project, use these maps to activate organizing, and make this project your own! Please reach out to us if you have an idea, a data set you'd like to see mapped, or any other questions! We are both deeply committed to an open source model of scientific practice built on skill sharing and peer education</p>.

Why baltimore?
Our goal: to create a coalition, a collective space, to interpret (?) the abolition geography of Baltimore 
Committed to open source science, teaching, and skill sharing
Encouraging people to view this project as their project, to study the complex histories of our city, understand the networks of power, control, resistance, and struggle that run through our geography, dream of new realities, and build towards a collective abolitionist geography 
To develop new ways to relate to one another and to Baltimore in a politics of care
This project is a collective call to action, to interpret our political realities, and to intervene in them through the material organization and building of abolitionist spaces – to make freedom a place.
