Abolition is not just the absence of prisons but the presence of other possibilities.
It is the simultaneous creation of places of freedom alongside the tearing down of systems of domination. 
Freedom must be materially built—through housing, land, schools, transit, healthcare, mutual aid—not simply imagined.
This work must simultaneously critique and reimagine, tear down and build up. 

We seek to answer: what will stand in the place of what we are dismantling? What are we building to grow in the gaps that empire leaves behind? How will we join efforts to build infrastructure that serves liberation? What will replace extraction and generate wealth for our people? How will we create systems for dignified work?
