# Confinement
Abandonment doesn’t happen accidentally or naturally – it is organized. It is produced by **public policy, economic restructuring, and institutional decisions** that divert investment away from some places while channeling it toward others. States, markets, and institutions actively decide: which neighborhoods lose hospitals, schools, transit, and jobs, which populations lose labor protections, welfare benefits, or housing security which people become “surplus” to capitalist needs. This process then creates the conditions in which policing, prisons, and punishment expand.

Organized abandonment is a structural condition that justifies the expansion of carceral systems. It turns communities’ survival needs into problems that prisons and policing are then falsely positioned to “solve.” 

Prisons don’t fill up because of rising crime; they fill up because people were abandoned, and criminalization becomes the response to that abandonment.

What fills the vacuum created by that abandonment? The state’s response to maintain control over abandoned communities is a politics of confinement. 

As Ruth Wilson Gilmore explains:

> *“In other words, against the scandal of documented deliberate neglect, criminalization remains a complicated means and process to achieve a simple thing: to enclose people in situations where they are expected, and in many ways compelled, to sicken and so die.”*

Heath Pearson, in *Carceral Capitalism in the Making*, argues that the carceral state isn’t just cages or prison walls. Confinement is any **spatial, economic, or social arrangement** that restricts a population’s capacity to move, act, survive, or even imagine otherwise.
